# Project Organization

MonitoraPA is composed of several components.

- A command line interface (in Python3) to run various automatic GDPR
  compliance checks on several systems (websites, email, cms...) and to automate
  some statistics and notifications to proper authorities in [cli/](./cli/),
  as specified in [ARCHITETTURA.md](./ARCHITETTURA.md) and
  documented in [MANUALE.md](./MANUALE.md)

- Some datasets to further extend the reach and impact of the project
  in [datasets/](./datasets/)

# Coding Guidelines

Code like if your hack should be maintained by a child who
just learned how to code.

Do NOT try to solve problems that you haven't measured before.

Do NOT apply any "enterprise best practice". We are not a company.  
Do NOT try to show us how smart you are. We don't care.

Avoid dependencies.

Use good sense... but remember: it's not common.
